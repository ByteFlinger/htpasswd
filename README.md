# htpasswd
Tool for generating and managing htpasswd files

CAUTION
---------------
I am not a crypto expert and cannot guarantee the security of this tool. The default hash implementation (MD5 APR1) seems to verify against what I get from openssl however it could do with an extra pair of eyes on both the hash the salt implementations
